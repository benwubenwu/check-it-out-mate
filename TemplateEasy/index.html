                <h1>What determines a player’s rank?</h1>
                <p>It is interesting to see how players rank among each other and although we see that Magnus
                    Carlsen
                    has
                    heavily dominated the chess environment, what determines their rank?</p>
                <p>
                    Players’ ranks are determined by the Elo ranking system which is a system that is
                    self-correcting
                    since
                    points are taken from the loser of a match and given to the winner. Therefore, a player’s Elo
                    rating
                    may
                    fluctuate depending on the outcome (either win or loss) of their game.
                    The Elo rating system is used universally and the average score for each country can differ.
