            Chess has a long history dating back almost 1500 years ago. It was first adapted from an Indian game named Chaturanga and spread throughout different parts of the world such as Asia and Europe. Chess has gone through many changes and alterations along its long history and did not become the familiar game we know it as today until the 16th century. 
            The game itself was widely enjoyed globally, but it was not until the late 19th century that the first official world championship title existed. Regardless of that milestone, Chess’s final form did not truly come into fruition until around the mid-20th century.

        <p>It is interesting to see how players rank among each other and although we see that Magnus Carlsen has heavily dominated the chess environment, what determines their rank?</p>
        <p>
            Players’ ranks are determined by the Elo ranking system which is a system that is self-correcting since points are taken from the loser of a match and given to the winner. Therefore, a player’s Elo rating may fluctuate depending on the outcome (either win or loss) of their game.
            The Elo rating system is used universally and the average score for each country can differ. Click around to explore the top 10 average chess ratings by country and year. What you see may surprise you!
